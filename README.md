Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration in 2020.
    - I have to dig to find the deadlines for absentee voting in 2020.
    - I have to do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Election dates & deadlines would be nice to present in a table.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The About Us page is the only one with centered text, so it seems a bit out of place.
    - Staff info is squeezed awkwardly into the sidebar. Seems to belong more on the About Us page anyway.
